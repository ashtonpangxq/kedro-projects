# Predicting House Prices

## Overview
Predicting House Prices with [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) using Machine Learning Models. 

Current Models used:
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `src/requirements.txt` for `pip` installation and `src/environment.yml` for `conda` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
kedro test
```

To configure the coverage threshold, go to the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To generate or update the dependency requirements for your project:

```
kedro build-reqs
```

This will `pip-compile` the contents of `src/requirements.txt` into a new file `src/requirements.lock`. You can see the output of the resolution by opening `src/requirements.lock`.

After this, if you'd like to update your project requirements, please update `src/requirements.txt` and re-run `kedro build-reqs`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, `catalog`, and `startup_error`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r src/requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### Creating Documentation with Kedro

```shell
kedro build-docs
```

Documentation is located under docs/build/html
