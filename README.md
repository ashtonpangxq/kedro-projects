# AI projects using Kedro Workflow
This repository contains all my AI projects using Kedro Workflow. 

## What is Kedro?
[Kedro](https://kedro.org/) is an open-source Python framework for creating reproducible, maintainable, and modular data science code. It borrows concepts from software engineering and applies them to machine-learning code; applied concepts include modularity, separation of concerns and versioning.

For the source code, take a look at the [Kedro repository on Github](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro)
